We can access the global object in node using the global keyword:

console.log(global);
The global object exposes a variety of useful properties about the environment. 
Also this is the place where functions as setImmediate and clearTimeout,setTimeout,setInterval are located.

The setTimeout(cb, ms) global function is used to run callback cb after at least ms milliseconds.


The setInterval(cb, ms) global function is used to run callback cb repeatedly after at least ms milliseconds.

The clearTimeout(t) global function is used to stop a timer that was previously created with setTimeout(). Here t is the timer returned by the setTimeout() function.

1)setTimeout(function(){
    console.log('3 second have passed');
},3000);


cmd->
C:\Users\sumsanto\Downloads\nodejs>node global
3 second have passed

2)var time=0;
setInterval(function(){
    time+=2;
    console.log(time + 'secong have passed');

},2000);

cmd->
C:\Users\sumsanto\Downloads\nodejs>node global
2secong have passed
4secong have passed
6secong have passed
8secong have passed
10secong have passed
12secong have passed
